Extract the entire document in **structured Markdown**.\n\n
RULES:\n
• Strictly no hallucinations. Values must be copied EXACTLY as written in the PDF
• Extract EVERYTHING — every table, value, date, name, rate, and detail — verbatim.\n
• **Do NOT skip or abbreviate ANY content.** Do NOT use ellipses (`...`) or shorten names, tables, or text.\
• Include all pages and all sections from start to finish.\n
• **Only** summarize long-form legal or boilerplate sections (e.g., indemnity, governing law, payment terms) in 2–3 sentences each.\n
• All business, financial, and operational content must be extracted fully — including long flighting tables, monthly allocations, added value sections, and any extended placement rows.\n
• Render all tables as properly formatted Markdown tables with full headers and all rows.\n
• Preserve numeric precision, currency symbols, and date formats exactly.\n
• Insert `<!-- Page N -->` comments where each new page begins.\n
• If any content is unreadable or appears as an image, mark it as `[UNREADABLE]` or `[IMAGE]` and continue — do NOT skip the section.\n
• Do not omit any section simply because it looks repetitive or long.\n
• Output Markdown only — no explanations or commentary.
