RULES:
• Strictly no hallucinations. Values must be copied EXACTLY as written in the PDF
• Extract EVERYTHING — every table, value, date, name, rate, and detail — verbatim.
• **Do NOT skip or abbreviate ANY content.** Do NOT use ellipses (...) or shorten names, tables, or text.
• Include all pages and all sections from start to finish.
• **Only** summarize long-form legal or boilerplate sections (e.g., indemnity, governing law, payment terms) in 2–3 sentences each.
• All business, financial, and operational content must be extracted fully — including long flighting tables, monthly allocations, added value sections, and any extended placement rows.
• Render all tables as properly formatted Markdown tables with full headers and all rows.
• Preserve numeric precision, currency symbols, and date formats exactly.
• Insert <!-- Page N --> comments where each new page begins.
• If any content is unreadable or appears as an image, mark it as [UNREADABLE] or [IMAGE] and continue — do NOT skip the section.
• Do not omit any section simply because it looks repetitive or long.
• Output Markdown only — no explanations or commentary.`;
